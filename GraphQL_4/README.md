This project demonstrates the usage of mutations (update & add) without relying on Apollo Server or a client. Instead, it utilizes the built-in GraphiQL tool, which includes its own server, for executing GraphQL queries and mutations. Nodemon is employed for automatic server restarts upon file changes, enhancing the development workflow. By leveraging GraphiQL and Nodemon, developers can conveniently interact with the GraphQL API and implement mutations seamlessly within the project environment.
